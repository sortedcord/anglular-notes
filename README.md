# Angular.js Notes

Angular is a framework for building apps in HTML, CSS and JS/TS

## Architecture of Angular Apps

Modern applications have two parts:
- **Front-end**-  What the user sees and interacts with. Includes UI > Angular. All about _presentation Logic_ and displaying data/ respoding to user action.
- **Back-end**- On the cloud. Does data processing and storage. DATA & APIs or _Business Logic_.

Front-end talks to the back-end to get/save data. Data isn't stored on the client [angular]. 

**API**: Endpoints that are accessible via the HTTP protocol.
They can be called by simple HTTP requests to get/save data.

Next step is to [set up the IDE](../blob/master/Setting up IDE.md) to create angular projects.
